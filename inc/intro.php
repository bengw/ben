	<h2>Let's Collaborate</h2>

	<p>How's it going? I'm Ben. A <strong>Web Developer</strong> and <strong>Digital Marketer</strong> from The Cotswolds, living in Brighton & Hove.</p>

	<p>I've been workng in the industry for <strong>5-years</strong> now and I've been fortunate enough to work for some <strong>top-drawer agencies in Gloucestershire and East Sussex</strong>. In that time I've worked with <strong>luxury 5-star hotel brands, multinational companies, charities, engineering firms, automotive companies</strong>, amoung other sectors.</p>

	<p>You'll usually find me screaming at the TV supporting Chelsea, running round a field in bright blue running shoes, exploring new places, trying new food, watching comedy panel shows, or painfully learning how to play the guitar.</p>

	<p><strong>I can help with any of the following:</strong> Web Design, Web Development, Digital Marketing (<abbr title="Search Engine Optimisation">SEO</abbr>, <abbr title="Pay-Per-Click Marketing">PPC</abbr>), Digital Strategy, UX Analysis, UX Design, WordPress Development, and Ecommerce.</p>
